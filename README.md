Table Format: The data is presented in a table with columns for "Distance Groups", "Flights", "Passengers", and "Flight Type".
Distance Ranges: The "Distance Groups" categorize flights into different mileage ranges (e.g., "Less Than 500 Miles", "8500-8999 Miles").
"Flights" and "Passengers": These columns show the number of flights and the number of passengers for each distance group.
"Flight Type": This column categorizes flights based on their type (e.g., "Domestic, Foreign Carriers", "International, US Carriers Only").
(Bottom Left - Load Factor Analysis)

"Load Factor % by Carrier Name": This chart shows the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for different airlines.
Bar Chart: The vertical bar chart compares the load factors of different airlines.
Percentage Scale: The vertical axis shows the load factor as a percentage, ranging from 0% to 20%.
Carrier Names on Horizontal Axis: The carrier names are listed along the horizontal axis, allowing for easy comparison of load factors.
Key Takeaways (Based on the Image):

Delta and Southwest are major carriers in terms of transported passengers.
